DogScepter is a work-in-progress modding tool geared toward (but not limited to) UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE by Toby Fox.

## Features
* Fully supports serializing/deserializing GameMaker data format ID 13 (an unknown version of GM:S 1) up to the GM 2022.6 runtime (format ID 17).
	* Note: There are some exceptions to this, with certain versions being undocumented or using unknown features.
* An "abstract"/"project" mode that deals with a custom project format on disk for ease in modding, even with multiple versions of a game.
* GML VM decompilation, for use in re-compiling back for modding purposes.
* Work-in-progress command line interface to deal with the aforementioned "project" mode, to deal with assets and compilation.
* Work-in-progress editor similar to that of UndertaleModTool, but simplified.

## Roadmap (subject to change)
- [x] Core library
    - Fully parse GameMaker IFF data files, store in memory, and be able to serialize them to new files byte-for-byte.
- [ ] Project system **(currently a work in progress)**
    - Convert from GameMaker structures into custom ones
    - Convert from custom structures back into GameMaker structures
    - Save and load these custom structures to JSON as necessary
    - Assets that are currently supported (as of last README update):
    	- General info/options
    	- Audio groups
    	- Texture groups (and dealing with textures in general)
    	- Paths
    	- Sounds
    	- Objects
		- Scripts
    	- Backgrounds
    	- Sprites
    	- Fonts
    	- Rooms
- [ ] Command line interface **(currently a work in progress)**
     - Simple CLI to allow actual work to be done with the above project system before everything else is done, including the UI itself. 
	 - As of writing this, the CLI has basic features and is somewhat usable with (or without) an interactive shell.
